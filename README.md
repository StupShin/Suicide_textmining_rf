# Suicide_textmining_rf

first, i got raw data file. so i coded with 33 keywords. that's coding.R

second, i should find episode. with appendix 1, i ordered keywords based on frequency from responses.
then, with appendix2_1.R, i separated files based on information from appendix1.R
Method number 1, i combinated 1 or 2 keywords, then checked frequency. less than 100, i deleted. that's appendix2_1.R
Method number 2, i found something important but not frequent. that's appendix2_2_all.R
